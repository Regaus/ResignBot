# ResignBot
A discord.py bot used for the Hackerclub in March 2025.

This project uses Python 3.12, discord.py, and Pillow.

## Setup
1. Create [your own bot](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
2. Copy `config_ex.json` and rename it to `config.json`
3. Configure your bot: set your bot's token in `config.json`
4. Set up the error channel ID, owner ID, and playing activity
5. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`
6. Start the bot using `python index.py`

Once you created your bot, you can use the following link to invite it to your server:<br>
https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=CLIENT_ID&scope=bot+applications.commands&permissions=67488832 <br>
Replace `CLIENT_ID` with your bot's user ID.
